if at least one table is declared forwardly then forward declare as many tables as possible
if relationships are used at all then forward declare tables as much as possible.

do not seperate declarations with blank lines.
one blank line is to seperate definitions from other definitions.
two blank lines are to seperate definitions and declarations.

use PascalCase for tables and templates, and camelCase for columns.

ideally, all custom types are to be forwardly declared at the top of the page,
followed by two blank lines, declarations AND definitions of all column templates, one blank
line, recursively declaring AND defining for all table templates, two blank lines,
all table forward declarations, two blank lines, table definitions with columns being
forwardly declared and relationships being declared AND defined, two blank lines, and finally
column definitions.
